# Data-Visulalization-Web-Development

<B>CSC 595</B>: Data visualization is one of the hottest skills on the job market today. <br>
This course teaches the fundamentals including how to make crisp, clear visualizations, how human perception works to
interpret information in images, how to use color, and the power of making visualizations interactive. <br>
Through a series of fun labs culminating in a final project, you will learn to leverage your programming background to build novel, 
interactive visualizations from scratch using D3 and JavaScript. <br>
Starting with common visualizations (e.g. scatter plots), we will move on to more complex data types 
(e.g. hierarchical, geospatial, networks), then learn to adopt existing visualizations from the web, 
and finish with a project to create your own interactive visualization with a python back-end and a D3 front-end.
